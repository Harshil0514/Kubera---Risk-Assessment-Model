KUBERA: A Dual-Model Corporate Risk AssessorView Live ApplicationThis project is a multi-page Streamlit web application that assesses corporate bankruptcy risk using two distinct machine learning models:API-Driven Assessor: A real-time model for public US companies using live data from the Financial Modeling Prep API.High-Accuracy Assessor: A high-performance model trained on real-world financial data from over 6,800 companies.Project Demo🚀 Key FeaturesMulti-Page Streamlit App: A clean, professional user interface built with Streamlit's multi-page functionality.Model 1: Real-Time API Model:Connects to the Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) API for live financial data.Takes any valid US stock ticker (e.g., AAPL, TSLA) as input.Provides a rapid risk assessment based on key financial ratios.Model 2: High-Accuracy Manual Model:A robust XGBoost model trained on the Kaggle "Company Bankruptcy Prediction" dataset.Features a Top-10 Feature Form for manual data entry, making the tool usable for small businesses or private companies.Explainable AI (XAI):Both models feature SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) force plots.This makes the model's decisions transparent by showing exactly which features (e.g., Net Profit Margin, Debt Ratio) pushed the risk score higher or lower.🛠️ Technical StackLanguage: Python 3.11Data Science: scikit-learn (StandardScaler), pandasMachine Learning: XGBoost (XGBClassifier)Explainability: shapWeb Framework: StreamlitPlotting: matplotlibAPI: requestsDeployment: Streamlit Cloud, Git/GitHub🔬 High-Accuracy Model: A Deeper DiveThe centerpiece of this project is the "Real Data Assessor," which is trained on a real-world dataset of 6,819 Polish companies.1. Feature SelectionThe initial dataset contained 95 different financial ratios. A 95-input form is unusable.To solve this, I first trained an XGBoost model on all 95 features. I then extracted the feature_importances_ to identify the Top 10 most predictive features. A new, final model was then trained only on these 10 features, resulting in a model that is both highly accurate and efficient.The Top 10 Features were:Continuous Interest Rate (After Tax)Total Debt/Total Net WorthDebt Ratio %Persistent EPS in the Last Four SeasonsBorrowing DependencyNet Value Per Share (C)Interest Expense RatioRevenue Per Share (Yuan ¥)Operating Profit RateRetained Earnings to Total Assets2. Model PerformanceThe final model was evaluated on a 20% hold-out test set. The performance proves its ability to find complex, non-linear patterns in financial data.MetricScoreBusiness ImplicationAccuracy95.97%The model is correct 96% of the time overall.Precision50.88%When the model predicts bankruptcy, it's correct 51% of the time.Recall40.91%The model successfully catches 41% of all actual bankruptcies.3. Performance AnalysisThe most important metric for a risk model is Recall, as failing to predict a bankruptcy (a false negative) is the most costly business error. A Recall of 41% is a strong baseline. The next step for this project would be to tune hyperparameters specifically to optimize for higher Recall (e.g., by adjusting scale_pos_weight), even if it means slightly lowering the overall 96% accuracy. This shows a "business-first" approach to model optimization.
